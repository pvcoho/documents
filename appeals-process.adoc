A policy must be revisited before the end of the defined period of time when at least three community members from different households request it in a written statement containing

* the text and consent date of the decision/policy,
* the names of the community members,
* the circle that the decision/policy originated in,
* the resons for the request, and
* the desired outcome.

The request should be made to the circle that the policy originated in. The circle must then revisit the policy and document the outcome in a timely manner.

If the requesting community members find that the outcome does not resolve the issue, they can submit the request to the parent circle or directly to the Full Circle.

TIP: The reasons for the request to revisit a policy can be based on the content of the policy, or on the process that was used to create the policy.
