# GOVERNANCE revised 2/17/2013

Our governance structure, like any other, will evolve as it is implemented and ideally adapts to fit the personality and culture where it is being applied. Previous structures that we’ve employed have likewise sought innovations and improvements and we hope and expect this one will too. This governance structure strives to address the following goals:

* Clear, specific, delegation of responsibilities
* Better coordination
* Methods to shepherd significant concerns
* Leadership development and increased participation in committees and work
* Fostering the social fabric of our community
* Promoting and providing for
** Equal voice
** Inclusivity
** Communication
** Mutual Support
** Trust

## Overview

The organizational governance structure of Pioneer Valley Cohousing will employ interlinking Circles. A Circle is a group of people with a specific purpose (also called an aim) who work together to accomplish that purpose, including making operations and policy decisions by consent within their specific area of responsibility (also called a domain). Term: For a period of 18 months, with systematic community evaluation to begin no later than the 12th month. At the end of the 18th month this governance agreement will terminate unless the Full Circle agrees by consent to continue. If this agreement is terminated, then the governance structure and process will revert to the previous agreements about governance.

## Governance Principles

The governance system will be guided by the following principles adapted from Dynamic Governance.

. The Principle of Circles PVCC will govern itself through semi-autonomous, self-organizing circles that are responsible for policy decisions within their area of responsibility. Each circle will be guided by input from community members using a variety of means such as Community Conversations, surveys, etc. Broader circles set and/or affirm the purpose and areas of responsibility for more focused circles. In the structure of circles, a more focused circle is double-linked to the next broader circle by the Circle leader and or more delegates of the more focused circle. For example, The Common House Circle would affirm the purpose and responsibilities of the Kitchen Circle. Circles determine their own membership. (See membership selection guidelines)
. The Principle of Consent Decisions by Circles are made by consent, including selection of people for circle membership roles, except as required by law and/or as otherwise stated in the bylaws.
  .. Meetings and decision making will proceed as outlined in the Consent and Meeting Process SummaryGuide (see appendix).
  .. Consent, a form of consensus, is defined as having no “argued and/or paramount objections.”
    ... A paramount objection reflects a concern that the proposal would have a negativehave negative effect on the Circle’s work to serve its purpose. Posed another way, paramount objections need to be based on the purpose and responsibilities of a circle and not on personal preferences. For example, one community goal is to have meals available for everyone twice a week. While some may have a personal preference for having all vegetarian meals, they would not have a paramount objection to meals that include meat unless there was no vegetarian option. To welcome everyone to community meals, we might object to a meal policy that never included meat or a meal policy that did not require a vegetarian option when a meat oriented meal was served.
    ... An argued objection means that the reasons for the objection are explained clearly enough for the Circle to collectively take responsibility for possible resolutions. For example, the Kitchen Circle is deciding a proposal to have tables of 8 instead of tables of 6. To say “I object because I like tables of 6 better” does not give the Circle a way to explore resolution. To say “I object because I find it easier to have more intimate and connected conversation in tables of 6” clarifies the underlying need and all can join in exploring strategies to meet that need.
  .. Failure to Reach Consent: If after all options have been exhausted, a Circle cannot achieve consent on a proposal, the decision is referred to the next broader circle (for example from B&G Work Circle to General Circle or General Circle to Full Circle).
. The Principle of Continual Adaptation All policy decisions will be in effect for a defined period of time, and be evaluated at or before the end of that period of time. The policy will then be terminated, continued or revised, as appropriate, based on that evaluation.

## Circle Structure

The organizational structure of PVCC Governance is based on a series of interlinked Circles— illustrated below in this “flower petal” image. The circles are described in a table in the Appendix titled “General Attributes of Circles and Sub-Circles.”

. Full Circle Comprised of all community members and associate members. 
. General Circle Comprised of the leaders and delegates of the four main Work Circles. 
. Work Circles B&G (Buildings & Grounds),Member Services, Common House, PALS (Plants, Animals, Land Stewards) 
. Work Sub-Circles Circles focused on a particular part of a Main Work Circle’s area of responsibility. For example, the Kitchen Circle is a Sub-Circle of the Common House Circle. 
. Expanded Work Circles A Work Circle plus its sub-circles as well as task-specific individuals. 
. Helping Circles Helping Circles research and recommend actions or policies to the Circle that created it. It can also carry out specific, short- term work assignments. For example, a Retreat Planning Circle would be a Helping Circle to the General Circle.

## Community Gatherings

There are two types of community gatherings: Community Conversations and Full Circle Meetings (described below). One or the other will occur monthly.

### Community Conversations

Community Conversations can be called by any Circle for the purpose of generating input that will help that Circle make a decision. Community Conversations are focused on exploration, dialogue and understanding and are not decision making meetings. All are welcome to attend and participate in Community Conversations.

### Full Circle Meetings

All residents and Associates are members of the Full Circle. Full Circle meetings are decision making meetings and will be scheduled by the General Circle as the need arises. At minimum there will be three Full Circle meetings a year - these include the annual retreat and the annual budget meeting. Other Full Circle meetings may be called by the General Circle, as needed for a major decision that meets one or more of the criteria stated under “Major Decisions,” as determined by the General Circle.

**MAJOR DECISIONS** These decisions are the responsibility of the Full Circle:

. Significant and permanent changes to the physical community; 
. Significant change to the governance structure; 
. Significant impact on members in terms of money, housing, and/or liability; 
. Changes to Master Deed and its amendments, Bylaws and its amendments, and agreements with the Town of Amherst; 
. Annual budget decisions and any mid-term revisions that increase the budget by more than 10%; 
. Decisions where the General Circle cannot achieve consent; and 
. Decisions of the General Circle that have been appealed by three or more individuals, no two from the same household. 

_Note:_ non-property owners may not object to budget decisions.

## Expanded Work Circles

Each Work Circle may have one or more Sub-Circles and/or Helping Circles, as well as individuals who do specific tasks but who is not a member of the Work Circle (for example, someone may be the bike room coordinator and connected to the Common House Circle but not participate in that Circle’s meetings).

All the associated groups and individuals connected to a Circle comprise its Expanded Work Circle. For example, the Common House Expanded Work Circle includes the Kitchen Committee, Cook Teams, Ad Hoc Library committee, Guest Room scheduler, etc.

Meetings may be called between and among these entities as relevant, i.e. Kitchen Committee and Cooks may meet; CH Committee may meet with all the basement coordinators to discuss new ideas for reorganizing that space, and so on. The purpose, area of responsibility, and evaluation will be determined specifically for each meeting.

## General Framework of All Circles

Membership Core members of a circle are individualsthose who carry out the responsibilities of that circle and who regularly attend meetings as set by the circle.* Affiliated Task Individuals There are other individuals who carry out tasks related to a particular Circle but are not core members of that circle. They are part of their relevant Expanded Work Circle.* Meeting Frequency Circles determine their own meeting frequency.* Purpose (Aim) To meet community needs by providing community services within their area of responsibility in ways that are effective, efficient and transparent.* Area of Responsibility (Domain) Is composed of the Ppolicies, operations, and budget of this Circle. Each establishes or confirms the purpose, area of responsibility and leadership selection of sub-circles. They call for Community Conversations and conduct other information gathering as needed to inform decisions that need greater input.* Evaluation (Measure) Minutes produced and posted for community access. Evaluation at conclusion of each meeting. Annual self-evaluation and by broader Circle. Periodic evaluations of specific projects according to their purposes (for example: are we achieving our intention of having 2 meals a week?).

### Criteria for Circle Membership

To ensure well-run productive Circles, every Circle will have a defined membership of individuals who agree to follow these best practices:

* attend Circle meetings regularly 
* inform the Circle Secretary if you will be absent
* carry out the Circle’s work in between meetings 
* make an effort to resolve interpersonal conflicts that occur within the Circle upon request of the Circle 

Each Circle can set additional criteria as long as they are clear and transparent and relevant to the Circle’s area of responsibility. 

The intention of the circle is to be inclusive and welcoming, balanced with the responsibility to respect and commit to the circle's forward progress. Therefore, new members may be asked to “get up to speed” by talking or working with a member between meetings so as not to slow down the work of the circle. 

No one may be denied membership in a Circle or asked to leave a Circle on the basis of personal preferences. 

If a member is having difficulty meeting the criteria, the Circle may initiate a respectful and open-minded conversation to understand what is going on for the member. If the member is not able to meet the Circle’s agreements, s/he may be asked to resign from Circle membership.

Non-Circle Members Attending Circle Meetings Community members are welcome to attend any Circle's meetings. Non-Circle members can always participate in a meeting's opening and closing go-rounds. Circles will reserve up to 15 minutes near the beginning of a Circle meeting to hear any community concern. The Circle may choose to invite anyone to present or comment on any topic at any time.

### Circle Member Roles

Circle Leader:: The Circle leader is selected by their Circle and confirmed by the next broader circle. Their role is to oversee operations of their Circle. The Circle leader is a member of both their Circle and the next broader Circle. The leader may make time-sensitive decisions without being authorized to do so by their Circle; those decisions must be reviewed at the next Circle meeting.

Facilitator:: A facilitator is selected by each circle to conduct circle meetings, provide leadership in decision- making, support listening and mutual understanding, and ensure that the circle is functioning based on the principles and methods of Dynamic Governance. The facilitator role can be rotated among members.

Secretary:: Each circle selects an administrative secretary to manage the affairs of the circle and perform tasks related to its functioning: such as arranging and announcing circle meetings, preparing the agenda in consultation with other Circle members, distributing study materials and proposals, taking minutes or ensuring that minutes are taken, distributing minutes, and performing any other tasks assigned by the Circle. As the keeper of the records, the Secretary interprets policies when questions arise.

Logbook Keeper:: A logbook keeper is selected by the Circle to maintain the circle logbook (see Logbook below). Depending on the size of the circle and the complexity of its work, the role of the logbook keeper may be combined with that of the Secretary.

Delegate(s):: Each Circle selects one or more delegates, other than the Circle leader, to participate in the next broader circle. Delegates participate as full members in both circles. A delegate cannot be the same person as the Circle leader.

With the exception of the Circle leader and the delegate(s) any member may fill more than one role, and roles may be combined.

Any selected role person may appoint a substitute to cover a temporary absence or a substitute may be made by the facilitator, secretary or Circle leader.

### Logbook

Each circle will create and maintain a logbook accessible to the full community that includes but is not limited to a) the circle’s purpose, policy decisions and meeting minutes; and b) any other documents that record the Circle’s activities and plans.

### Ongoing Learning

Each Circle is responsible for the ongoing learning of its members in three areas: communication/interpersonal relationships, governance structure/meeting and work processes and work content (as in finances in a Finance Committee and equipment repair in Buildings & Grounds). The General Circle is responsible for community-wide skill building and education.

### Everyone has a Voice

How Individuals influence Decisions made by a Circle (see diagram of Feedback Loops)

*Both-And* The aim is to both maintain the integrity of Circles to make decisions within their area of responsibility and have appropriate community input on those decisions.

#### Input Process

A question comes to a Circle -- it may decide the question, research it, survey community members, or send the question to another Circle for input or decision. A Circle may appoint a Helping Circle to research the question and make a recommendation. For example, the Egg Chicken Club can appoint an ad hoc “Expansion Committee” to research the issue and come back to the Club with a recommendation. A Circle can ask for time in a Community Conversation to generate more input. These Community Conversations will be held monthly (or more or less as needed) with dates predetermined annually. In addition, any individual can give input to any Circle member. Any individual can request to be heard by any Circle that they are not a member of. All Circle meeting minutes will be publicly available.

#### Appeal Process

Any individual may appeal any decision made by any Circle. That appeal will first be heard by the Circle(s) to which the individual belongs. If that Circle agrees with the appeal, they will send selected delegates to the Circle which made the decision. These delegates will temporarily join the Circle that made the original decision for the purpose of confirming, rejecting or amending the decision in question.

Alternatively, three individuals, no two from the same house, can appeal any decision to the circle that made the decision. To facilitate a timely response and avoid holding up a decision, the following process is recommended:  

Those appealing will go to the circle that made the decision, in order to confirm or amend that decision (in one session); if not successful in that session, those with concerns along with circle delegates seek assistance from Care and Counsel to get resolution (within two sessions). 

If that is not successful, it moves to the next broader circle.

## Evaluation / Measure

How we will evaluate this Governance Agreement.

* Frequency of Circle Meetings
* Attendance of Circle Members
* Record of Circle Meetings (Minutes)* Availability of Minutes to all community members
* Summary of policy decisions that have been made in the period
* Survey of Satisfaction with those decisions
* Summary of objections that arose and how they were processed
* Evaluations in each Circle and in the Full Circle (General Meeting) - what went well, what could have been improved, suggestions for improvement
* Effectiveness: are decisions getting made, is the community functioning as well or better than before?* Efficiency:is the speed with which decisions & actions are taken appropriate to the decisions or actions?* Transparency is there easy community access to information about the decisions made by the Circle?* Consent decision in a Full Circle: Are there objections to continuing the experiment?

## Proposal for Implementation

Implementation Assistance The Governance Group will become the DG Implementation Circle, an ad hoc helping circle of the General Circle. Amendment approved at February 10 GM: The Implementation Helping Circle will be a defined size (6-8), with a selection process based on criteria for what the job would be, with the whole community involved in the decision on membership.1

Its purpose is to support the implementation of the proposal. Its areas of responsibility are a) training with all Circles until such time as the General Circle is working effectively and can take on serving the other Circles, b) education of the full community and c) creating and/or improving support systems (documentation, facilitation, evaluation, etc.).

Process for Selecting Work Circle Representatives Each of the four Work Circles will have a meeting open to all community members. The agenda will be to a) state the purpose & area of responsibility of the Circle, b) identify who is willing to serve as core Circle members, c) review the roles of leader and delegate, d) identify the qualities desired in each, e) select leader and delegate from among the core members, f) and set a next meeting time.

All community members in attendance will be invited to nominate and give input on candidates; final decision will be made by those members who are part of the Expanded Work Circle. For example, the Expanded Common House Work Circle includes individuals who have regular work responsibility related to the Common House – kitchen committee, clean teams, meals bookkeeping, guest room calendar, etc. After the selection process, if needed, a debrief will be offered which allows members to hear from each other and, if requested, to help a member or members find support for other ways of contributing or building skill in preparation for future leadership opportunities.

Initial Meeting of Work Circles Each Circle will select a secretary and a facilitator or facilitation system. The secretary does not need to be the note keeper for each meeting but is responsible for maintaining circle communication and documentation, including meeting minutes.

Affirming Circle Representatives Once the leaders and delegates of the four Work Circles have been identified, there will be a meeting of the Full Circle (General Meeting) which will a) confirm the composition of the General Circle, and b) present a relevant skills building training session (see list below). Work Circles will then set and/or confirm the structure of their sub-circles and their purposes, areas of responsibility, and membership.

## Responsibilities of the Governance Implementation Circle
* Support ongoing education in all aspects of PVC Governance as needed;
* Assist in creating systems for recording minutes and making them accessible to all through Internet tools such as Google Drive;
* Serve, at the General Circle’s direction, to identify and organize additional needed training for Circles and/or for individual roles (facilitator, secretary, etc); and to recommend organizational design improvements;
* Help organize other skill building activities to strengthen the community’s governance process, regardless of the form of governance employed. This could include: minute taking, documentation system, facilitation, evaluation, reflective listening, and nonviolent communication.

_Criteria considered on the February 10th General Meeting includes: 2 hours / week available; knowledge of DG and this particular incarnation of it; High skill & tolerance for lots of meetings; energetic about PVC Governance; knowledgeable about community, plus newer community members; good listeners, empathy skills; able to discern the problem; good interpersonal skills; identify concerns, process them effectively; good teachers / trainers_

(Informational only; not part of proposal)

### CHALLENGES OF CURRENT SYSTEM

* It depends on the capacity of burning souls to bring a change process to conclusion before they burn out with the lack of a supportive organizational structure. For many, this dampens the motivation to propose improvements for our community.
* When someone with a good idea is not the “appropriate” person to be the burning soul, the idea is unlikely to move forward
* There is little connection among committees and between committees and the general meeting
* We don’t have easy access to current information such as community agreements and committee minutes
* We’ve developed a culture against making decisions - new ones take too much energy and old ones are hard to change and rarely evaluated
* Knowing how hard it is to change our decisions means the stakes are very high when we make them
* Leadership is voluntary rather than intentional
* It is challenging to step forward to be a leader
* No clear responsibility for what falls through the cracks
* Since decision process is driven by individuals, issues get personalized
* Examples of unresolved community items:

Master planning (from years ago) - first attempt Master planning (currently in limbo) - recent attempt Governance Review of design review Outdoor cat policy Work accountability Carports Sumac Invasives management Meat animals Trees and solar gain Parking Keeping agreements Private use of community resources

### PVC GOVERNANCE: RATIONALE

* A new system can help shift old habits
* several people have the energy and enthusiasm to try
* Provides an organizational structure and framework to promote effectiveness, efficiency, transparency, inclusiveness, and equivalence of voice
* Provides a framework for decision making and meeting process in many ways similar to what we do now, but with more standard process that is replicable in all meetings
* Provides more leadership roles and more shared leadership by those who do the work of the community.
* We won’t know if this is an improvement unless we try.

Rationale for choosing Circle leaders using a selection process

* identified leadership provides a clear focus of responsibility and accountability
* the selection process invites people to step into leadership through appreciation of their skills and qualities. Volunteerism is about who wants or is willing to do the job. In selection the question is who do we want to invite to consider the job. Selection really broadens the pool of possible candidates.

Rationale for Circle member responsibilities

* identify a clear focus of responsibility and accountability
* effective use of labor time (emphasis on doing)
* it is in the doing of the work of the circle that individuals will acquire the experience necessary to make effective decisions
* clarity and consistency of membership allows for greater connection, mutual support, learning, development, effectiveness and efficiency
